Islamic history spans over 1400 years! From the Prophet Muhammad's teachings in 7th century Arabia, it blossomed into a global civilization
Think vast empires, trade routes, scientific breakthroughs, beautiful architecture like the Taj Mahal, and influential scholars like Ibn Sina (Avicenna)
 Islam spread across continents, influencing art, literature, and even mathematics
 It wasn't all smooth sailing, though
 There were conflicts and debates, leading to different interpretations and sects within the faith
 Yet, its enduring legacy lives on, shaping the world today
